/**
Arduino class library for ST M41T00S real-time clock.

The M41T00S Serial Access TIMEKEEPER SRAM is a low power serial RTC 
with a builtin 32.768 kHz oscillator (external crystal controlled). 
Eight bytes of the SRAM are used for the clock/calendar function and are 
configured in binary coded decimal (BCD) format. Addresses and data are 
transferred serially via a two line, bidirectional I2C interface. The 
built-in address register is incremented automatically after each WRITE 
or READ data byte.

The M41T00S has a built-in power sense circuit which detects power 
failures and automatically switches to the battery supply when a power 
failure occurs. The energy needed to sustain the clock operations can be 
supplied by a small lithium button supply when a power failure occurs. 
The eight clock address locations contain the century, year, month, 
date, day, hour, minute, and second in 24-hour BCD format. Corrections 
for 28, 29 (leap year - valid until year 2100), 30 and 31 day months are 
made automatically.
